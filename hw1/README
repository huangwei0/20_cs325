The insertsort.cpp is use inset sort algorithm to make the integers in data.text have a correct sequence.
The mergesort.cpp is use merge sort algorithm to make the integers in data.text have a correct sequence.
The inserTime.cpp is check the time for sort the integer by insert SORT.
The mergeTime.cpp is check the time for sort the integer by megrt SORT.

Complier for insertsort.cpp
complier: enter"g++ insertsort.cpp" on the commentline
run: enter "a.out"
Then the file list will shows file call "insert.out" that will shows the correct sequence of integers.

Complier for mergesort.cpp
complier: enter"g++ mergesort.cpp" on the commentline
run: enter "a.out"
Then the file list will shows file call "merge.out" that will shows the correct sequence of integers.

For my meges sort that only can sequence the integer for the first line, so you only can see the correct sequence of integers for first line.


Complier for inserTime.cpp
complier: enter"gcc insertTime.cpp" on the commentline
run: enter "a.out"
The the file list will shows "InserTimesAvg.out" that shows the time cost of insert sort to sequence
